In the course **Taller práctico de bioinformática Posgrado en Ciencias Biológicas UNAM** I presented the next issues:

* [How do I loop with two variables](https://github.com/Melcatus/genomic_cotton/issues/4)

* [What database use to cotton genome annotation?](https://github.com/Melcatus/genomic_cotton/issues/9)

* [How to prevent the end of disk space?](https://github.com/Melcatus/genomic_cotton/issues/11)

The first two were resolved, and the last one requires different tests that were recommended
