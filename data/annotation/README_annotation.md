####### In this directory are the files that can be used to annotate the genomes.
They were used as a sample for my [issue 2](https://github.com/Melcatus/genomic_cotton/issues/9).
The files were downloaded from the website of [CottonGen](https://www.cottongen.org/data/download/genome_tetraploid/AD1).
